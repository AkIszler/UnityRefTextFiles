// take current pos, and assign it to a centered position
// Using transform (lower case t) followed by .position, .rotation .Scale allows you to 
change the Position(or other) on a game object the script is attacted too, depending on
if its a 2d or 3d game you can use it with a Vector3 OR Vector2 (3 being X,Y,Z) and 2
is X and Y 

(X,Y,Z) and (X,Y) the nunmbers set inside will define the transforms function.
a good example is Vector3(0, 0, 25); will send the object forward on the Z axis by 25
units. 

Key notes Vecttor 2 is used for 2d and X Y movemets
most of the time you will use a "new Vector3" to define a new set of numbers
but you can make a variable with a vector2/3 and use it as a static set of numbers
(WATCH OUT) using "T" transform (upper case T) it can throw an error code
	
(USE CASE) - use it to place a player at a starting position OR for fast travel teleports 
	
    transform.position = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); 
// this will place object at 0, 0, 0 or centered.

Transform.Translate - Moves the transform in the direction and distance of translation.
Description - Moves the transform in the direction and distance of translation
	
Basic Declaration 
public void Translate(Vector3 translation); OR
public void Translate(Vector3 translation, Space relativeTo = Space.Self); 

// Move the object forward along its z axis 1 unit/second.
        transform.Translate(0, 0, Time.deltaTime);
	(BREAKDOWN) transform.Translate will move the object at set amount
	(0[x], 1[y], 0{z}) this will set the movement amount 1 unit "up" 
	Time.deltaTime = 1/60 seconds. Locks to "60 fps" used to keep the 
	movement at a set amount and not change based of FPS
